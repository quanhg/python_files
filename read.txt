首先要做的就是要在熟读下 prd，这里面主要需要挖掘如下信息：

本次 prd 的业务背景是什么？
这个业务要实现的价值是怎样的？
这个业务的受益方（或者叫使用者）是谁？
本次业务都需要与哪些外部部门进行合作，联调方都有哪些？
本次功能的改造是否涉及了历史功能的改造？即需要明确下改造范围
本次功能的改造都涉及了哪些测试方向，除了功能、UI、易用性、接口、冒烟、回归，是否还需要数据测试、性能测试？
笔者认为，最起码应该明确了上面的问题，才算是一次合格的需求分析，它将为您了解整个待测系统的来龙去脉提供强有力的支撑。
The first thing to do is to familiarize yourself with the prd, which requires the following information:

What is the business context of the prd?
What is the value to be realized by this business?
Who are the beneficiaries (or users) of the prd?
Which external departments do the prd need to cooperate with, and who are the coordinators?
Does the revamping of this function involve the revamping of historical functions? This means that the scope of the modification needs to be clarified
What testing directions are involved in the transformation of this function, in addition to functionality, UI, ease of use, 
interface, smoke, regression, is there a need for data testing, performance testing?
In my opinion, at least the above issues should be clarified before it is regarded as a qualified requirements analysis,
which will provide strong support for you to understand the ins and outs of the whole system to be tested.
I AM NOT SURE
